*For this inventory, I will be writing as if Odysseus was my brother. Honestly, I have a hard time emphasizing with Penelope (or any fictional characters with a setting so different from mine). My brother, Erik, is 11, and is relatively high on the Autistic Spectrum*

What drives me forward, and I imagine many others, in life is continuing to improve upon my passions and conquering obstacles in my way. Thus, for my cloth of encouragement, I would weave images of obstacles that Erik has faced and images of his own passions.

For obstacles, since he’s on the spectrum, I would weave an image of Albert Einstein, who by most accounts was probably on the spectrum, and was obviously tremendously successful.  I would also weave an image of Odysseus himself, someone who had an incredible amount of obstacles, but succeeded through his own willpower, hard work (and a little help from the gods). Erik’s passions, at least at the time of writing this, is a mixture of the video game Minecraft and his interest in studying various diseases (in order to stop them). Thus, I would weave images of Minecraft and of famous scientists like Louis Pasteur who have helped stop the spread of disease.

Using some web magic, here's what a portion of my cloth would look like.
