Hektor tells Aeneas to take his holy figures, the statues of his Ancestors, and the sacred flame of Troy, before Aeneas flees to hopefully found a new settlement and bring safety to others. All three of the items Hektor commands Aeneas to bring are related to the shared Heritage of the citizens of Troy. Thus, I think Hektor tells Aeneas to specifically bring these three items because of the importance of remembering our heritage during times of struggle. When people struggle, they look to the past for inspiration to move towards the future. For someone like Aeneas, and the refugees he leads, having the memory of sacred flame of Troy, and how it represented peace and prosperity, will motivate them to found a new settlement that will last for eternity, like the flame.

I agree that our heritage is important to remember, so If I had to flee my Home/Chicago because of some sort of disaster, like Aeneas, and I could only bring a certain portion of things with me, I would first try to bring items that are of important sentimental matter to me and/or my family. Things that would be the most sentimental to me would be any items that in some way or another make up a part of who I am today. Thus most of these items would be from my upbringing.

### With all that being said, in no particular order here are some objects I would bring:

* Electronic Globe: One of my first gifts was an electronic globe where I could tap each country and learn about the country's history and current demographics. It propelled me into becoming a history fan I used it to memorize geography from a young age.

* Godzilla DVD Collection: Back when getting the Japanese-Produced movies of Godzilla was difficult, my dad got me the entire collection when I turned 10, and I became a huge fan. Other than that it means a lot to me because I've now been showing the movies to my brother.

* Foundation Books: In Middle School, my Dad gave me his Foundation (A Sci-Fi series by Issac Asimov) bookset that he had bought in high school. This means alot to me for two reasons, first being that the series are some of my favorite books of all time, and secondly, because of the value it showed that my Dac placed on me.

* Rose Crest: My family heritage can be traced to a Scottish Highlander Clan called the "Rose clan" that were forcibly moved to America after a failed revolt. My grandfather passed down a wooden crest with our clan emblem. Honestly it's kinda hoakey, but it's a nice way to remember both my Grandfather and my heritage.
