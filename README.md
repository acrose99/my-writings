## Q: Why are you doing this?
 A: I'm doing this for basically two reasons:

### 1.Becoming better at Computer Science and the humanities at the same time.
   - I'm making this site on something called [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which is made up of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) files. This is probably is either confusing or uninteresting to you, which is fine, but for me it's an opportunity to keep up my CS skills *while* writing. This is super cool, at least to me, since it means I'm basically using all of my brain power at once.
### 2. Website design allows my writing to be more creative and pretty.
  As someone who comes from a background in the humanities, I've always really liked and valued how the process of writing allows you to be creative and/or broaden your horizons. Now, I don't think I'm very good at it, but I do try to write something original biweekly.

  Now I realize this is very niche, but I'm tired of handing in documents. They all look the same. When I write with any word processor, I lose part of the humanity behind writing.

  With all that said, a couple weeks ago, I wrote and got the courage to share a technical piece called  [The Ultimate Guide to Tracking Your GitHub Monthly Contributions](https://acrose99.github.io/blog/The%20Ultimate%20Guide%20to%20Tracking%20Your%20GitHub%20Monthly%20Contributions.html). I published it on my public facing website, and used some of my own CSS to style the page.

  After publishing that, I had an epiphany. This random thing I wrote looks infinitely better than anything else I've written, simply because it has elements of my own style. In other words, I had regained the creativity behind writing.

  By making this site and using it for my writings, even the simplest of papers, I can regain that creativity.
